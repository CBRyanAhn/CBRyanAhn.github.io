        My research work predominantly sits at the nexus of construction, human factor, and artificial 
        Intelligence and empowers society and the construction industry to build smart, safe, and connected 
        living and working spaces. Specifically, my core research includes smart and safe construction using 
        IoT and AI, education and training using VR/MR/AR, and human-robot collaboration in construction.     </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">
        I was an associate professor in <a href="http://www.snc.ac.kr">Seoul National University</a> (2022-2024),
         an assistant professor in <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> (2017-2021) and 
         <a href="https://www.unl.edu/">the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a> (2012-2017).
        Currently, I am serving as an executive officer in <a href="https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/computing-division/committees/computing-division/executive-committee/technical-committees/data-sensing-and-analysis-committee">the ASCE Computing Division Data Sensing and 
        Analysis Committee</a>, and I have served as the president of <a href="https://www.kacepma.org/">the Korean-American Construction Engineering 
        and Project Management Association</a>. My specialization lies in smart construction, and my research 
        has been recognized by many awards, including Best Paper Awards in the ASCE International Conference 
        on Computing in Civil Engineering (2019) and the International Conference on Construction Engineering 
        and Project Management (2013).
